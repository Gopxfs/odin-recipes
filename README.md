# odin-recipes
The project that i'm starting now is about a recipe website. I will put everything that I learned so far to write and shape this website to look as useful and pretty as I can.
I will demonstrate my HTML skills, such as putting images and editing texts in an organized manner. In the future, I will shape this website with CSS and (maybe) javascript.
This is just a test to see if I know how to refresh this archive at github.
